        <p class="title">About</p>

        <p> I’m Giel Boogaerts, a 23-year-old graphic designer from Belgium. My main interests are graphic design,
            photography, and traveling.
        </p>

        <p> I’m especially passionate about typography and book design — a fascination that extends beyond creating to
            collecting well-designed books.
        </p>

        <p> In contrary to my personality, I aim to stand out with my designs through originality and concept. I believe
            that functionality should always drive aesthetics, giving each project a deeper sense of purpose and
            meaning.
        </p>

        <p> I graduated with honors from the International Master of Reading Type & Typography under the guidance of Dr.
            Prof. Ann Bessemans and the READSEARCH team at PXL-MAD School of Arts. Throughout my master’s and bachelor’s
            studies, I developed a strong passion for book design, which became the focus of my master’s project.
        </p>

        <p> Currently, I am continuing to deepen my expertise in typography through the Typography & Book program, while
            also expanding my skill set with a study in Digital Design. T&B I chose for understanding more about the making and producing of books.
            As much as the practical and theoretical side of it. I am doing Digital Design to broaden my field beyond printing and to be a more whole designer.
