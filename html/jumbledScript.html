            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>For this bachelor project the subject was dyslexia.
                I focused on the aspect of similarities between glyphs and the confusion between them through rotation and mirroring.
                I took 13 popular typefaces and modified them by overlapping the similar glyphs. By doing this I robustly try to recreate the situation of dyslexia.
                As they don't always know which glyph they read, the reader also does not know as they can identify multiple options in one glyph.
                The book is accompanied by three posters which are spreads within the book.
